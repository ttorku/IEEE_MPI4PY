# IEEE_MPI4PY

This paper entails application of parallel processing techniques to data preprocessing and modelling.
A popular python library MPI4Py is deployed to speed up the preprocessing of data. For comparative analysis, 
a COVID-19 data is preprocessed with and without MPI. We analyze the results of the two scenarios.

The step by step process to run our code:

1. You can run each cell at time or

2. Go to kernel >> Restart Kernel and Run all

3. Before you run make sure that the following python libraries are imported.
   - numpy
   - pandas
   - matplotlib
   - sklearn for minimax scaling
   - time for checking cpu time




Below is the system design
