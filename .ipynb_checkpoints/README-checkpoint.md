# CSCI_6330_project

This project entails application of parallel processing techniques to data preprocessing and modelling.
A popular python library MPI4Py is deployed to speed up the preprocessing of data. For comparative analysis, 
a COVID-19 data is preprocessed with and without MPI. We analyze the results of the two scenarios.

Below is the system design
